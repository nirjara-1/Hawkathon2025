Threaded: Connected by Kindness 
🧵 Problem: Mismatched Giving in Communities
Millions of people donate clothes, food, and supplies yearly to help others, yet many of these donations never reach the people who need them most or arrive too late to make a meaningful difference. This disconnect is more than inconvenient — it's systemic.

📊 Supporting Data:
🧺 85% of textiles donated in the U.S. end up in landfills or are exported overseas, never making a local impact.

🥫 30-40% of food in the U.S. is wasted, even while 42 million people struggle with hunger.

🏠 Nonprofits report that more than half of their received donations are either irrelevant, unsorted, or unusable, increasing the sorting workload and reducing efficiency.

This reveals a major gap: generosity exists, but the system to direct it efficiently is broken.
